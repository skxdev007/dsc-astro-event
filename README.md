## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### npm install fails
- Make sure you have Node.js 18+ installed: `node --version`
- Try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again
- Check your internet connection

### Port already in use
- The dev server runs on port 4321 by default
- Kill the existing process or use a different port:
  ```bash
  npm run dev -- --port 3000
  ```

### Build fails on Vercel
- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Ensure Node.js version is set correctly in Vercel settings (18.x or higher)
- Check build logs for specific errors

### Images not loading
- Make sure images are in the `public/` folder
- Use correct paths (e.g., `/image.png` for files in public/)
- Check file names and extensions

### Template not working after customization
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all required files are present
- Make sure you didn't accidentally delete important files
- Try reverting changes and applying them one at a time
